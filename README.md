# Delorean Bot
Utility bot for discord chat service written in javascript. Current 
commands are basic but growing

# Using Bot Code
This bot code can be quickly cloned and modified for personal use,
the only thing missing is a file named botsettings.json, which you
would load with:\n
{\n
	token: <bot token>\n
	prefix: <bot prefix>\n
}\n
You can also modify the database and access and writing functions for your
own CSV.
